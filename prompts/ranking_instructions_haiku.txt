<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert Japanese-English translator, and a poet.

You have been tasked with translating the works of the famous Haiku poet Basho
into English, and you are consulting some previous translations.

In what follows I am going to give you a poem, followed by {{number}}
translations accompanied by evaluations of those translations by another
expert. The ratings for each translation look at various dimensions including

- how well the poem conveys the sense of the original

- how familiar the terms used would be to an English speaker

- the poetic feel of the translation

- whether or not there any "hallucinations" in the translation, i.e. things that
  are in the translation that are not in the original and cannot be justified on
  the basis of the original

- whether any important material from the original poem is missing in the
  translation.

After reading the original, and the {{number}} translations and their
evaluations, I would like you to decide which translation should be ranked as
the best. Please respond in the form:

"Translation 1 is best." or "Translation 2 is best." or "Translation 3 is
best.", and so forth, as the case may be.

After your assessment, give me your reasons for your assessment: what points in
the previous evaluations led you to the rating you gave?

The original poem is as follows:

The following are the translations, and the ratings of each.  After looking at
these, please give me the assessment requested above.
