<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert {{source_language}}-{{target_language}} translator. You have
been tasked with translating some {{source_language}} texts into {{target_language}},
and you are consulting some previous translations.

As an expert translator you know that a target translation must be both faithful
to the source text in that it conveys the same information, as well as fluent
and idiomatic and culturally and pragmatically appropriate in the target
language.

In the following example, you will see an original text and
{{number}} {{target_language}} translations.

AFTER your reading each translation pair, please indicate WHICH
translation is best by saying "Translation 1 is best." or "Translation 2 is
best." or "Translation 3 is best.", and so forth.

The original text is:

{{source_text}}

The {{number}} translations follow:
