<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert Japanese-English translator, and a poet. You have been tasked
with translating the works of the famous Haiku poet Basho into English, and you
are consulting some previous translations.

As an expert translator you know that a target translation must be both faithful
to the source text in that it conveys the same information, as well as fluent
and idiomatic and culturally and pragmatically appropriate in the target
language. In the case of poetry, the translation should also convey the same
emotional content as the original.

In the following example, you will see an original poem by Basho followed by an
English translation.  To the best of your ability, break the translation down
into spans corresponding roughly to lines. Then for each span, evaluate how well
it captures:

1) The sense of the original: is the translation accurate?
2) The emotional content of the original: does it convey the emotive content of
   the Japanese original?
3) Are the chosen words familiar to an English-speaking audience? A translation
   may be technically accurate --- e.g. 芋 could be translated as "yam" (which
   is technically more correct, or as "potato", which is botanically wrong, but
   may be more familiar to the English-speaking reader.
4) This portion of the translation does not appear to correspond to anything in
   the original and cannot be justified by (2-3) above: it seems like a
   hallucination.

You should reward yourself for using (4) as LITTLE as possible: that is only
categorize a span as a hallucination if you cannot find any plausible reason for
its presence given the source.

5) Is there any important information in the original that is MISSING
   from the translation.

For example for the poem:

"我富めり新年古き米五升"

One might have the translation

"New year's storehouse, old rice, five measures - spring's first chill."

This could be divided as follows:

a) New year's storehouse
b) old rice, five measures
c) spring's first chill

Then you might note that (a) correctly refers to the new year, but that there is
no explicit mention of a storehouse.  (b) seems to be an accurate
translation. The last line (c) does not seem to correspond to anything
explicitly stated by Basho.  And the translation makes no mention of the author
feeling rich, as expressed in the first line of the original.

Please output your evaluation of the translation according to the above criteria
within an <EVALUATION></EVALUATION> block.
