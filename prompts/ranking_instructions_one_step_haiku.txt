<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert {{source_language}}-{{target_language}} translator, and a poet. You have been tasked
with translating the works of the famous Haiku poet Basho into English, and you
are consulting some previous translations.

As an expert translator you know that a target translation must be both faithful
to the source text in that it conveys the same information, as well as fluent
and idiomatic and culturally and pragmatically appropriate in the target
language. In the case of poetry, the translation should also convey the same
emotional content as the original.  Indeed, it has been said that to translate
poetry, one must be a poet, and so the poetic nature of the target translation
is particularly important.

In the following example, you will see an original poem by Basho and
{{number}} {{target_language}} translations. For each translation, to the best of your ability,
break the translation down into spans corresponding roughly to lines. Then for
each span, evaluate how well it captures:

1) The sense of the original: is the translation accurate? What sights, sounds,
   smells, feelings does the original poem convey? Are those well conveyed by
   the translation?
2) Are the chosen words familiar to an English-speaking audience? A translation
   may be technically accurate --- e.g. 芋 could be translated as "yam", which
   is technically more correct, or as "potato", which is botanically wrong, but
   may be more familiar to the English-speaking reader.
3) The poetic feeling of the translation. Does it use poetic language? Does it
   attempt to mimic the poetic structure of the original?
4) This portion of the translation does not appear to correspond to anything in
   the original and cannot be justified by (2-3) above: it seems like a
   hallucination.

You should reward yourself for using (4) as LITTLE as possible: that is only
categorize a span as a hallucination if you cannot find any plausible reason for
its presence given the source. Finally:

5) Is there any important information, sensory or emotional content, in the
   original that is MISSING from the translation?

For example for the poem:

"我富めり新年古き米五升"

One might have the translation

"New year's storehouse, old rice, five measures - spring's first chill."

This could be divided as follows:

a) New year's storehouse
b) old rice, five measures
c) spring's first chill

Then you might note that (a) correctly refers to the new year, but that there is
no explicit mention of a storehouse in the original.  (b) seems to be an
accurate translation. The last line (c) does not seem to correspond to anything
explicitly stated by Basho, and it conveys a different sense, the chill of early
spring, that was not necessarily intended by the poet.  And the translation
makes no mention of the author feeling rich, as expressed in the first line of
the original.

AFTER your evaluation of each translation pair, please indicate WHICH
translation is best by saying "Translation 1 is best." or "Translation 2 is
best." or "Translation 3 is best.", and so forth.

Finally, based on your assessment of the provided translations, please see if
you can provide a better translation. Enclose that translation in a
<translation></translation> block.
