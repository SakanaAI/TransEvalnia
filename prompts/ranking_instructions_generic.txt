<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert {{source_language}}-{{target_language}} translator.

You have been tasked with translating various {{source_language}} texts into
{{target_language}}, and you are consulting some previous translations.

In what follows I am going to give you a text, followed by {{number}}
translations accompanied by evaluations of those translations by another
expert. The ratings for each translation look at various dimensions including

1. Accuracy: Does the translation convey the sense of the original accurately?

2. Terminology:  Do the terms used conform to normative terminology standards
   and are the terms in the target text the correct equivalents of the
   corresponding term in the source text?

3. Linguistic Conventions:  Is the translation fluid and grammatical?

4. Audience Appropriateness: Are the chosen words and expressions familiar to a
   {{target_language}}-speaking audience?

5. Hallucinations: This portion of the translation does not appear to correspond
   to anything in the original and cannot be justified by any need to adapt the
   text to the target audience. It seems like a hallucination.

6. Missing Content: Is there any important information in the original that is
   missing from the translation?

After reading the original, and the {{number}} translations and their
evaluations, I would like you to decide which translation should be ranked as
the best. Please respond in the form:

"Translation 1 is best." or "Translation 2 is best." or "Translation 3 is
best.", and so forth, as the case may be.

After your assessment, give me your reasons for your assessment: what points in
the previous evaluations led you to the rating you gave?

The original text is as follows:

{{source_text}}

The following are the translations, and the ratings of each.  After looking at
these, please give me the assessment requested above.
