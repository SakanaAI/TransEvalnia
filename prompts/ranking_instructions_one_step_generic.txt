<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are an expert {{source_language}}-{{target_language}} translator. You have
been tasked with translating some {{source_language}} texts into {{target_language}},
and you are consulting some previous translations.

As an expert translator you know that a target translation must be both faithful
to the source text in that it conveys the same information, as well as fluent
and idiomatic and culturally and pragmatically appropriate in the target
language.

In the following example, you will see an original text and
{{number}} {{target_language}} translations. For each translation, to the best
of your ability, break the translation down into spans corresponding roughly to
lines. Then for each span, evaluate how well it captures:

1. Accuracy: Does the translation convey the sense of the original accurately?

2. Terminology:  Do the terms used conform to normative terminology standards
   and are the terms in the target text the correct equivalents of the
   corresponding term in the source text?

3. Linguistic Conventions:  Is the translation fluid and grammatical?

4. Audience Appropriateness: Are the chosen words and expressions familiar to a
   {{target_language}}-speaking audience?

5. Hallucinations: This portion of the translation does not appear to correspond
   to anything in the original and cannot be justified by any need to adapt the
   text to the target audience. It seems like a hallucination.

You should reward yourself for using (5) as LITTLE as possible: that is only
categorize a span as a hallucination if you cannot find any plausible reason for
its presence given the source.

6. Missing Content: Is there any important information in the original that is
   missing from the translation?

For example for the source sentence

"Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally"

One might have a translation:

"サラ・パレンは、ドナルド・トランプのラリーでトラック・パレンのPTSDを引用しました。"

This could be broken down and analyzed as follows:

"""
Span 1: サラ・パレンは、
ACCURACY: Accurate translation of "Sarah Palin"
TERMINOLOGY: Correct use of the Japanese name for Sarah Palin
LINGUISTIC CONVENTIONS: Grammatically correct
AUDIENCE APPROPRIATENESS: Appropriate for a Japanese audience

	  which doesn't fully capture the nuance of "cites" in this context
TERMINOLOGY: Correct use of "PTSD" and the Japanese name for Track Palin
LINGUISTIC CONVENTIONS: Grammatically correct
AUDIENCE APPROPRIATENESS: Appropriate for a Japanese audience

Overall, the translation is largely accurate and appropriate for a Japanese
audience. The main issue is the slight misinterpretation of "cites" as "quoted"
rather than "mentioned" or "brought up." A more natural translation might use "
言及しました" (mentioned) or "取り上げました" (brought up) instead of "引用しま
した."
